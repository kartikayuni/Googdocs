# Using Google Docs as a Whiteboard

Google Docs is an online text editor similar to MS Word or OpenOffice Write. Since the files can be
shared and edited by multiple users simultaneously, it makes an ideal whiteboard for online classes.

To make life easier, create a Google account, if you haven't got one yet. Registering a Gmail
account is probably the best way to do it. Google Drive is accessible from the menu in the top-right
corner of the Gmail main page.

Once I know your Gmail address, I'll set up a file and share it with you. You will receive a link to
that file to your Gmail address. If, after clicking the link, you will see a document with a
welcoming message in your browser, you are set up for your lesson.

# Getting Started with Basic 

To find another person on the file click **Share** button on the top-right corner.

To easier navigate your document create headings. To create a heading place the cursor on the text and press **Ctrl + Alt + 1**. 

To see table of contents of the file click the small icon **Show document outline** on the left.

To add a comment press together **Ctrl + Alt + M**.
