# A guide of how to use Google Docs as a whiteboard

This blog post is created mainly for language teacher and learner so that both parties do not have to send a pdf file or Ms.Word everytime they want to use it. So, without much talking here are the steps:

1. First, you need to have a Google account, if you don't have one yet then set up a Google account. 

2. Once you've set up a Google account then go to Google search type in "Google Docs" and click it as shown in the picture below:

3. Now that you are already in the Google docs page, click on the "Blank" to create a new page and start your work by writing some text. 
You can then share the file with another party, in this case would be a teacher that shares a file to student. Click "Share" button on the top right corner of the page and you will need to fill out the email of the person you want to share the file with and then click "Done".

4. What's next? The other party will receive a Google Docs invitation on their email, they can then access the file.

Note: In some countries like Japan or Korea the student or the receiver of email invitation **has to** send the request to the sender to get an acces to the document.
